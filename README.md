# Tutorials
In this repository I'll store every tutorial I follow. I'll do this to not only practice and learn new things, but also to keep track of my progress.
I intend to write a descriptive section to each tutorial while maintaing a pattern. This will make my study more robust and easier to follow.
Now let's list and comment about each tutorial.
